# To Do Web
To Do is a website for managing your tasks.

## About
This project is containing two tables, those are todo table (for managing tasks data) and user table (for managing user). All tables are related to each other directly or indirectly. The logic in this system was written following by Model View Controller.

## Getting Started
This project is using several third-party modules including express, sequalize, pg-sequalize, etc. For database, this website is using postgreSQL. So if you're about to run this program, you need to install those modules first. After that, run 'npm install' and 'npm start' in your terminal. Before doing migration, you also need to run 'sequelize init' first. This repository doesn't have any frontend page (user interface), so for testing you would need 'postman' aplication. Run the program from your terminal by using this command : 'node index.js'.
